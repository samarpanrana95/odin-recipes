                <li>Using an electric whisk beat 110g softened butter and 110g golden caster sugar together until pale and fluffy then whisk in 2 large eggs, one at a time, scraping down the sides of the bowl after each addition.</li>

                <li>Bake for 15 mins until golden brown and a skewer inserted into the middle of each cake comes out clean. Leave to cool completely on a wire rack.</li>
                <li>To make the buttercream, whisk 150g softened butter until super soft then add 300g icing sugar, 1 tsp vanilla extract and a pinch of salt.</li>
                <li>Whisk together until smooth (start off slowly to avoid an icing sugar cloud) then beat in 3 tbsp milk.</li>
                <li>If wanting to colour, stir in the food colouring now. Spoon or pipe onto the cooled cupcakes.</li>
